          I'm Karolis - highly motivated and passionate self-taught frontend
          engineer. I'm fascinated about nutrition, human performance, strength
          training and everything in between.

        <p class="text-justify mb-2">
          During the pas few years I found myself constantly exploring the
          latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world
          and having a great desire to learn new things. Code and design are my
          passion. I have what it takes to be a great developer and currently
          I'm actively looking for new opportunities to show my skills. My
          github profile might not shine with the complex projects, but I
          encourage you to asses my skills with a homework assignment or on site
          and I will not make you disappointed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify mb-3">
          Thank you for your time, and letâ€™s get in touch to talk about the
          future.
