          Hi, my name is Karolis, I’m highly motivated and passionate
          self-taught frontend engineer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify mb-2">
          I found myself constantly exploring the latest technology advancements
          in the front-end web development world and having a great desire to
          learn new things. Code and design are my passion. I have what it takes
          to be a great developer and currently I'm actively looking for new
          opportunities. My github profile might not shine with the complex
          projects, but I encourage you to asses my skills with a homework
          assignment or on site and I will not make you disappointed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify mb-2">
          Thank you for your time, and let’s get in touch to talk about the
          future.
        </p>
