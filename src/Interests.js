          Hi, my name is Karolis, I’m highly motivated and passionate
          self-taught frontend engineer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify mb-2">
          I found myself constantly exploring the latest technology advancements
          in the front-end web development world and eager to learn. I have a
          great desire to excel and do what I love – code and design. I always
          knew I have what it takes to be a developer and currently, I'm
          actively looking for new opportunities. My github profile might not
          shine with the complex projects, but I encourage you to challenge my
          skills with a homework assignment or on site.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify mb-2">
          Thank you for your time, and let’s get in touch to talk about the
          future.
        </p>
